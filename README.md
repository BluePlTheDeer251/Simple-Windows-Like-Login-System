Hello! Welcome to my first repository, this is my first ever project on GitHub, it works as it follows:
1. Edit the inSystem_user and inSystem_password variables(optional)
2. You run the code (so obvious)
3. You enter a user and a password so the system can check if something is True or False
4. Enjoy the results!
