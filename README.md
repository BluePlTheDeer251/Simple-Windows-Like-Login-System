Hello! Welcome to my first repository, this is my first ever project on GitHub, it works as it follows:
1. Open pass.py (the code)
2. Edit the inSystem_user and inSystem_password variables' content (optional)
3. You run the code (so obvious)
4. You enter a user and a password so the system can check if something is True or False
5. Enjoy the results!
